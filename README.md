- 👋 Hi, I’m @onetruemortie
- 👀 I’m interested in learning html and css.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and css.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing until I've learnt something.
- 📫 How to reach me: send up a short long long short smokesignal at the apex of himalaya and I will magically appear out of an elephants trunk situated in a zoo near you.
